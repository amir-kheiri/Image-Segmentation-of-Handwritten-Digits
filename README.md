# Image-Segmentation-of-Handwritten-Digits

we built a model that predicts the segmentation masks of handwritten digits. This model will be trained on
the M2NIST dataset. we built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch for the downsampling
path and use a Fully Convolutional Network, FCN-8, to upsample and produce the pixel-wise label map
